Not much can be done on the frontend side, regarding data, since backend is sending the whole json object,
but there are still some improvements that we can do on the frontend.
Some of the optimizations are:
    - Multiple stylesheet files for different screen sizes. If we put media queries in one css file, the whole css file should be returned from the server.
    - Minification of css and js, so the size can be smaller.
    - Bundling multiple files in one file in order to make only one request instead of multiple.
    - Lazy loading to load carousels on demand.
    - Using Service Worker API for better performance like caching and offline experience.
