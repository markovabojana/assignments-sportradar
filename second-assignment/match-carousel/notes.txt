Known issues

1. Team names are too large and in some cases the card is getting too large.
2. One of the edge cases that is not covered:
    - All statuses other than 0 and 100 are indicating that the match is started (per documentation),
     but when status is "Postponed", the result is not shown on the card. Date should be shown for the
     future match date.
3. URL for obtaining png images for team/country flags does not work.
